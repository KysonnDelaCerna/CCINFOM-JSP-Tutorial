        The form tag is used to group certain inputs together to be submitted.
        This is a way to take input from the user and send it to another file for processing.

        The action="/processing.jsp" defines where the data collected in the form will be submitted once the user
        submits the form

        The method attribute is used to define what method will be used when submitting the data (either GET or POST).
        The main difference between the two is that when a user submits data using the GET method, the data will just be
        appended to the URL. On the other hand, the POST method sends it through a more secure way. Because of this, the
        POST method is used for transferring forms containing sensitive data such as passwords. Since a person's name is not
        really senstive data, it is safe to just use the GET method.

    <form action="/processing.jsp" method="GET">
        <!--
            The label tag creates a text label for a certain input. The for attribute defines which input the label is
            bound to. When the user clicks the label, it will automatically highlight the input with an id matching its for attribute.
        -->
        <label for="fullname">Full Name: </label>

        <!--
            The input tag allows the user to input data.
            
            The type attribute is used to define what type of input is needed from the user (type=”text” is used for plain text inputs).
            
            The id attribute allows the label tag to find the input it is tied to.

            The name attribute defines what the value inside the input will be named as once submitted.
            
            The required attribute makes it so that the user can’t submit the form while this field is still empty.
        -->
        <input type="text" id="fullname" name="fullname" required>

        <!--
            The input with type=”submit” is the submit button for the form.
            The string within the value attribute defines what will be written on the button.
        -->
        <input type="submit" value="Submit Form">
