This is a sample of an HTML file. Everything enclosed within `<` and `>` are called tags. Additionally, things enclosed in just `< >` are called opening tags and things enclosed in `</ >` are called closing tags.

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` indicates that the file is an HTML file. This is to tell your browser that this file is an HTML file and should be interpreted as such. 

Everything enclosed by `<html>` and `</html>` is the content of your page. The `lang=”en”` part just tells your browser that the web page is in English. 

`<head></head>` and `<body></body>` are ways to group similar tags. Things within `<head></head>` contain metadata or information about the web page itself.

The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tells your browser what type of character encoding to use.

The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` allows the proper scaling of elements inside your web page. It's ok if you don't understand what these mean yet, you can copy and paste them for now. These will be discussed in future classes.

The `<title></title>` defines what the title of the page should be. This can be seen in the name of the tab in the browser.

Things within `<body></body>` define the content of the web page.

The `<h1></h1>`, which stands for heading, displays the text within it onto the web page. Heading is usually used for important texts inside the web page such as article titles.
